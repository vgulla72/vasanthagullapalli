    <h2>About</h2>
      Hi, I’m Vasantha Gullapalli. I’m a senior engineering and product leader with nearly three decades of experience across Global Services at Publicis Sapient, Media and Publishing at Dow Jones, and High Tech at Amazon. Along the way, I’ve lived and worked in both India and the US, which has shaped my perspective as a global leader. I’ve also made intentional pivots into entrepreneurship, consulting, and full-time politics and public service.
    After nearly nine years at Amazon and close to thirty years of nonstop work, I sought more freedom. The freedom to slow down, reflect, and be more deliberate about how I spend my time and where I apply my energy.
    That pause brought clarity. Three themes rose to the top and now define where I focus my time, when I’m not traveling, hiking, or spending time with friends and family.
    <h3>People connections</h3>
      I mentor mid-to-senior leaders in tech, women in tech, and professionals balancing career ambition with the rest of life. My work focuses on helping leaders scale impact in high-pressure engineering environments, manage transitions across roles or industries, and design careers aligned with what truly matters.
