    <h2>Welcome! Namaste!</h2>
      <p>
  Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vgulla/">Vasantha Gullapalli</a>. I’m a senior engineering and product leader with nearly three decades of experience across Global Services at Publicis Sapient, Media and Publishing at Dow Jones, and High Tech at Amazon. Along the way, I’ve lived and worked in both India and the U.S., which has shaped how I think about leadership, careers, and impact in a global context.
  <p>Over the years, I’ve also made intentional pivots into entrepreneurship, consulting, and public service. 
  After nearly nine years at Amazon and close to thirty years of nonstop work, I chose to slow down. I wanted more freedom. Freedom to reflect, to be deliberate, and to spend my time on work that feels meaningful and aligned.
  That pause brought clarity. Some themes rose to the top and now define where I focus my time, when I’m not traveling, hiking, spending time with myself or with friends and family.</p>
  <p>This site is my hub on the internet. It’s where I bring together the passion projects I’m actively spending time on today. These projects sit at the intersection of technology, careers, leadership, and lifelong learning. 
    Each one is in a different stage of exploration and I will keep posting meaningful updates from time to time.
  I invite you to click around and explore.
  If something here resonates and you’d like to learn more as these ideas evolve, exchange perspectives, or partner with me in some way, I’d love for you to sign up or reach out.
  <p>You can also <a href="mailto:vasantha.gullapalli@gmail.com">email me directly</a></p>
  Thanks for being here.
