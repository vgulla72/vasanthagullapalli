    <h1 class="mb-4">Professional Services</h1>

    <p>
      Since stepping away from Amazon in 2025, I’ve intentionally designed the next phase of my personal and professional life. Alongside long-standing personal interests, I am focused on giving back to the industry by enabling leaders and strengthening organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am most effective in consulting and fractional leadership roles, where I help organizations scale by developing leadership capability and removing execution bottlenecks through clear, scalable operating mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am selective about engagements and take on work that genuinely excites me. That excitement is usually driven by a combination of the people and the mission.

    <h2 class="mb-4">Background</h2>

    <p>
      I began my career as a software engineer and grew into a cross-functional leadership role, building and leading diverse teams across engineering, applied science, data engineering, analytics, product management, and technical program management.
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience spans global services at Publicis Sapient, media and publishing at Dow Jones (including WSJ.com, Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com), and large-scale consumer businesses at Amazon. Across these environments, I’ve consistently operated at the intersection of business strategy, technology, and people leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring a structured, outcomes-driven approach to diagnosing organizational challenges. I quickly understand business priorities, assess operating landscapes, identify bottlenecks, and translate insights into clear, actionable paths forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m known as a pragmatic, people-first leader who builds high-performing teams with strong ownership, disciplined execution, and a bias for innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having lived and worked in both India and the U.S., and balanced a demanding career alongside family responsibilities, I bring a global perspective on leadership, work cultures, and organizational dynamics.
