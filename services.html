      <h1>Professional Services</h1>

      <p>
        Since stepping out of my full-time role at 
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> 
        in 2025, I’ve taken time to intentionally design the next phase of my personal and professional life.
        Alongside pursuing long-standing personal interests, I am now interested in giving back to the industry
        by enabling leaders and strengthening organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am most effective in consulting and fractional leadership roles, where I help organizations scale
        by developing leadership capability and removing execution bottlenecks through clear, scalable
        operating mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am selective about engagements and take on work that genuinely excites me.
        That excitement is usually driven by a combination of the people and the mission.
      </p>

      <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>

      <ul class="services-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Hiring & Developing Talent</strong><br />
          Build data-driven hiring, performance, and talent management processes that raise the talent bar
          and strengthen leadership pipelines.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Leadership Development</strong><br />
          Mentor and develop emerging leaders to build leaders who scale and develop others.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Organization Design</strong><br />
          Design organizational structures that balance collaboration with clear accountability.

        <li>
          <strong>Operational Excellence</strong><br />
          Audit and optimize operating mechanisms to improve execution quality, predictability, and scalability.

          Streamline planning, budgeting, and business review mechanisms to improve alignment, agility,
          and capital efficiency.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mentorship</h2>

      <p>
        I mentor mid-to-senior leaders in tech, women in tech, and professionals balancing career ambition
        with the rest of life. My work focuses on helping leaders scale their impact in high-pressure
        engineering environments, navigate role or industry transitions, and design careers aligned with
        what truly matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mentorship and coaching are offered through <a href="https://topmate.io/vasantha_gullapalli" class="external-link">Topmate</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        I began my career as a software engineer and grew into a cross-functional leadership role,
        building and leading diverse teams across engineering, applied science, data engineering,
        analytics, product management, and technical program management.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience spans global services at 
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong>,
        media and publishing at 
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</strong>
        (including WSJ.com, Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com), and large-scale consumer businesses at Amazon.
        Across these environments, I’ve consistently operated at the intersection of business strategy,
        technology, and people leadership.
      </p>

      <p>
        I bring a structured, outcomes-driven approach to diagnosing organizational challenges.
        I quickly understand business priorities, assess the technology and operating landscape,
        identify structural and execution bottlenecks, and translate insights into clear, actionable
        paths forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m known as a pragmatic, people-first leader who builds high-performing teams with strong ownership,
        disciplined execution, and a bias for innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also lived the reality of balancing a demanding career with the needs of a young family
        and aging parents. Having lived and worked in both India and the U.S., I bring a global perspective
        on leadership, work cultures, and organizational dynamics.
