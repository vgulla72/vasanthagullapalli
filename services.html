      <h1>Professional Services</h1>
      <p>
        Since stepping out of my full-time role at Amazon in 2025, I’ve taken time to intentionally design the next phase of my personal and professional life.
        Alongside pursuing long-standing personal interests, I am now interested in giving back to the industry
        by enabling leaders and strengthening organizations.<br />
        I am most effective in consulting and fractional leadership roles, where I help organizations scale
        by developing leadership capability and removing execution bottlenecks through clear, scalable
        operating mechanisms.<br />
        I am selective about engagements and take on work that genuinely excites me.
        That excitement is usually driven by a combination of the people and the mission.
      </p>

    <h3>Mentorship</h3>
        I mentor mid-to-senior leaders in tech, women in tech, and professionals balancing career ambition
        with the rest of life. My work focuses on helping leaders scale their impact in high-pressure
        engineering environments, navigate role or industry transitions, and design careers aligned with
        what truly matters.<br />
        Mentorship and coaching are offered through <a href="https://topmate.io/vasantha_gullapalli" class="external-link">Topmate</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I began my career as a software engineer and grew into a cross-functional leadership role,
        building and leading diverse teams across engineering, applied science, data engineering,
        analytics, product management, and technical program management.<br />
        My experience spans global services at Publics Sapient, media and publishing at 
        Dow Jones(including WSJ.com, Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com), and large-scale consumer businesses at Amazon.
        Across these environments, I’ve consistently operated at the intersection of business strategy,
        technology, and people leadership.<br />
        I bring a structured, outcomes-driven approach to diagnosing organizational challenges.
        I quickly understand business priorities, assess the technology and operating landscape,
        identify structural and execution bottlenecks, and translate insights into clear, actionable
        paths forward.<br />
        I’m known as a pragmatic, people-first leader who builds high-performing teams with strong ownership,
        disciplined execution, and a bias for innovation.<br />
        I have also experienced the "juggle" of balancing a demanding career with the needs of a young family
        and aging parents. Having lived and worked in both India and the U.S., I bring a global perspective
        on leadership, work cultures, and organizational dynamics.
